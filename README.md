#Overview of project: 
Project: DOCKER CONTAINERIZATION
Objective: Containerizing a web application using Docker to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Writing a Dockerfile to containerize a
simple web application. Build and run Docker containers locally.

Key Activities: Here are the steps how I containerized my web app written in golang.

        1. We write a simple web-application in golang. You can see that in main.go file. The web-app returns Hello World when main file is run and we expose this on port 8080
           so whenever we run the code in local system than, we can access this web-app on browser using localhost:8080
